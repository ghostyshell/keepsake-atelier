Keepsake Atelier is a desktop workshop for the discs you already own. It reads
what is on a Blu-ray or DVD, takes it apart without re-encoding when you do not
want to, puts a new disc together when you do, and checks the result before it
reaches a writer.

It uses native tooling wherever possible: libbluray for navigation, libaacs for
decryption, `newfs_udf` and `hdiutil` for UDF 2.50 images and burns on macOS,
and a bundled ffmpeg for muxing and encoding. The app runs on macOS, Linux and
Windows from one Rust engine.

Apple Silicon or Intel on macOS 12 or newer, plus Linux x86_64 and Windows
x86_64 builds. The links are refreshed weekly because GoFile expires free-tier
files. The [project site](https://ghostyshell.github.io/keepsake-atelier/#downloads)
reads the same manifest.

The DMG and the macOS CLI tarball are self-contained: libbluray, libaacs,
libbdplus and their dependencies are inside, built with a macOS 12.0 deployment
target. The CLI tarball also carries ffmpeg, ffprobe and the menu JAR. Both
support macOS 12 or newer.

The Linux CLI tarball and the Windows CLI zip carry the same library closure
plus ffmpeg, ffprobe and the menu JAR, so neither needs a system ffmpeg.

The app is not notarized. On first launch, right-click the app,
choose **Open**, then confirm. Or clear the quarantine flag:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Keepsake Atelier.app"
```

The tarballs are the CLI only. Unpack one and keep its `lib/`, `ffmpeg`,
`ffprobe` and `00000.jar` beside `keepsake-atelier`; put the binary on your
`PATH` if you want the command line without the app. Linux also ships an
AppImage and a deb; Windows ships a CLI zip and an NSIS installer. Both desktop
builds are previews, and the macOS DMG is the reference app. See
[docs/platforms.md](docs/platforms.md) for what works on each platform.

## Support

The app is MIT and stays free. There is no paid tier.

- **Discord:** https://discord.gg/SUaUrVGj5f
- **Ko-fi:** https://ko-fi.com/ghosty99
- **Ethereum:** `0xbBef115aD853236a350EaF04777a2AdB2e7c0317` ([Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbBef115aD853236a350EaF04777a2AdB2e7c0317))

## Quick start

```sh
keepsake-atelier doctor                     # what is installed and connected
keepsake-atelier devices                    # optical drives
keepsake-atelier disc /Volumes/MY_DISC      # titles, playlists, streams
keepsake-atelier rip /Volumes/MY_DISC       # main title, lossless remux
keepsake-atelier verify /Volumes/MY_DISC    # navigation and clip check
```

Authoring:

```sh
keepsake-atelier author movie.mkv --out movie.iso --label MY_MOVIE
keepsake-atelier author ep1.mkv ep2.mkv --out season.iso --menu
```

Burning is opt-in:

```sh
keepsake-atelier burn movie.iso             # dry run, prints the command
keepsake-atelier burn movie.iso --yes       # writes the disc
```

The app exposes the same workflow as cards: discs, titles, rips, authoring,
menus, keys, DVD, covers, queue, verify, burn and system check.

## What it does

- **Inspect.** Title map, playlists, clips, durations, chapters, streams, HDR,
  AACS state, and the navigation table from `index.bdmv`.
- **Keys.** Native AACS1 recovery from the drive's volume ID and the disc's MKB
  on macOS, Linux and Windows, plus AACS2 unit keys derived offline from
  `Unit_Key_RO.inf`. KEYDB import, search and edit. MakeMKV dumps are a
  fallback, not a requirement.
- **Rip.** Lossless remux to MKV or MP4, or x264, x265 and VideoToolbox encode.
  English non-commentary audio by default, subtitles off, chapters and metadata
  kept.
- **Author.** One title or many, a BDMV folder or a native UDF 2.50 ISO, chapter
  marks from the inputs, optional BD-J title menu, and BD-25/BD-50 splitting.
- **Menus.** A real 1080p BD-J menu with one row per title, a background,
  arrows, digits and mouse. One generic Xlet reads the disc's own `menu.txt`.
  Menu documents can be parsed, edited, saved and applied to another disc.
- **DVD.** List and rip `VIDEO_TS` titles through ffmpeg's `dvdvideo` demuxer.
- **TV.** Split a disc into per-episode files with SxxExx names, OP/ED detection
  and TMDB metadata.
- **Copy.** 1:1 encrypted clone, decrypted ISO, or a plain folder.
- **Verify.** Walk every title, movie object, playlist, clip and menu row before
  you burn.
- **Burn.** Native `hdiutil burn` on macOS, growisofs on Linux, and Windows'
  IMAPI2 stack. Dry run by default. Confirmation required.
- **Automate.** Every capability is a CLI command and an MCP tool. The server is
  off by default and binds to loopback.

The complete list, including limits and caveats, is in
[docs/features.md](docs/features.md).

## Build from source

Prerequisites on macOS:

- Xcode command line tools, Rust and Node.
- Homebrew libraries: `libbluray libaacs libbdplus`.
- The bundled ffmpeg is built once with `scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh`.

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/keepsake-atelier doctor

cd app
npm install
npm run tauri dev       # development
npm run tauri build     # app and DMG
npm run test:ui         # Playwright checks against the mock bridge
```

`npm run dev:mock` opens the shell in a plain browser with a fixture drive,
disc and KEYDB, so the layout and interactions can be exercised without a
drive. `npm run test:ui` runs the same fixture headlessly: landmarks, the skip
link, reading a disc, the command palette, the shortcuts sheet, the compact
rail and reduced motion.

`BLURAY_PREFIX` overrides the libbluray prefix. `KEEPSAKE_FFMPEG` points at a
specific ffmpeg. The pre-rename `BLUFORGE_*` environment names are still
accepted.

## Architecture

```
core/           keepsake-core - framework-agnostic engine (Rust)
  device.rs       IOKit device enumeration, optical detection
  keys.rs         KEYDB.cfg store, search, validation
  native.rs       native AACS1/AACS2 key recovery
  disc.rs         libbluray FFI (titles, decrypted title streaming)
  bluray_shim.c   small C shim so Rust avoids libbluray struct layout churn
  menu.rs         menu documents: index.bdmv navigation + editable templates
  bdjo.rs         BD-J object writer for authored title menus
  assets/menu/    the generic menu Xlet (00000.jar) and its source
  bdmv.rs         multi-title index/MovieObject writer, menu install
  udf.rs          native UDF 2.50 images with newfs_udf and hdiutil
  udf_portable.rs portable UDF 2.50 images (hadris-cd) for Linux and Windows
  burn.rs         hdiutil burn / growisofs orchestration
  rip.rs          ffmpeg orchestration (remux / encode) with progress
  dvd.rs          DVD-Video title parse and rip
  iso.rs          decrypted ISO and folder export
  verify.rs       navigation, playlist, clip and menu checks
  config.rs       persisted settings
cli/            `keepsake-atelier` - headless CLI
app/            Tauri v2 desktop app (React + TypeScript frontend)
  src-tauri/      Rust commands bridging the UI to core
docs/           guides, feature list, publishing and the project site
scripts/        ffmpeg build, menu asset, release publishing, weekly refresh
```

Decryption is Rust orchestration over libbluray plus an AACS backend. libaacs
with the local KEYDB is the default. MakeMKV's `libmmbd` is used only as a
fallback for a disc that cannot be keyed natively, or for BD+ without VM data.
ffmpeg is used only for muxing and encoding, never decryption.

## Publishing

Releases are published to GoFile and mirrored to file.kiwi. A launchd job
rebuilds the current version, re-uploads the artifacts, repoints
`docs/downloads.json` and the README table, commits the change and cleans up the
local build. See [docs/publishing.md](docs/publishing.md).

```sh
scripts/publish-release.sh          # build, upload, patch links, push
scripts/refresh-release-links.sh    # what the weekly job runs
scripts/install-refresh-job.sh      # install the launchd agent
```

## Testing without a drive

`scripts/mkbd.mjs` builds a small but spec-valid BDMV tree (index, MovieObject,
playlist, clip and an ffmpeg-made H.264 + AC-3 clip), so the whole pipeline runs
with no hardware:

```sh
node scripts/mkbd.mjs /tmp/testbd 8
./target/release/keepsake-atelier disc /tmp/testbd
./target/release/keepsake-atelier rip  /tmp/testbd /tmp/out.mkv --title 0
./target/release/keepsake-atelier iso  /tmp/testbd /tmp/out.iso --label SINTEL
```

The test suite runs with `cargo test`.

## Notes and limits

- macOS first. The macOS app is the reference build. Linux ships a tested CLI
  plus AppImage and deb previews; Windows ships a CLI zip and an NSIS installer
  preview. See [docs/platforms.md](docs/platforms.md) for the per-platform
  matrix.
- Cinavia is a proprietary audio watermark. The app measures it and can notch
  it out (`cinavia detect` / `cinavia strip`, or the Rip page's Strip Cinavia
  option), re-encoding to the source format by default (AC-3, E-AC-3, DTS,
  TrueHD). Atmos is detected and its bed is kept; the objects cannot be
  re-created. It costs some level and brightness and cannot be verified without
  a Cinavia-aware player. See [docs/guides/cinavia.md](docs/guides/cinavia.md).
- Authored BD-J menus are verified in a JVM harness and by libbluray's parser,
  not on a hardware player. They are opt-in.
- Burning needs a writer and a blank BD-RE or BD-R. The drive and size query are
  tested; a physical write is still worth doing on your own media.
- Native key recovery needs a LibreDrive vendor read. Stock firmware on some
  drives does not provide it. libaacs with a KEYDB entry still decrypts.
